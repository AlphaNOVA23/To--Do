# Simple To-Do List App

This is a basic To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Enter and add new tasks to the list.
- Delete individual tasks using a dedicated button.

## Features:

- User-friendly interface with an input field and a task list.
- Basic input validation to prevent adding empty tasks.
- Clear separation of concerns with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Setup:

1. Create three files:
    - `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure of the application.
    - `style.css` - Defines the styles for the application's appearance.
    - `app.js` - Implements the JavaScript logic for adding and deleting tasks.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the corresponding files.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the To-Do List app.

## Code Breakdown:

- index.html: Defines the basic structure of the application with HTML elements like input field, button, and an unordered list to display tasks.
- style.css: Provides styling for the various elements, including fonts, colors, layout, and button appearance.
- app.js: Handles the functionality of the application. It uses JavaScript to retrieve DOM elements, handle user interaction, and manage the task list.

## Customization:

- You can modify the styles in `style.css` to personalize the appearance of the application.
- Consider adding features like task editing, task completion marking, or local storage to persist tasks across sessions.
